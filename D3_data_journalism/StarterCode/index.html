          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Obesity According to US Census</h2>
          <p>According to US Census Data from 2014, obesity and poverty levels are directly correlated. As seen in this chart here, there is a correlation showing states with higher levels of poverty tend to have higher obesity levels. </p>

          <p>Hover over the circles for each state to identify poverty and obesity levels. This chart depicts a positive trend, with states such as Hawaii, Colorado, and Massachusetts have lower poverty and obesity levels. States such as Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana have higher obesity and poverty rates.</p>

          <p>The demographic data shows that civilians in states with high levels of poverty are at a greater health risk for obesity which puts people at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. This trend surrounds the idea of food prices and could be looked into further with cheaper food vs. nutritional content. </p>
