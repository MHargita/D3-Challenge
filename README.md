# D3-Challenge

Using the d3 library and the provided data from the U.S. Census Bureau, I created a scatter plot comparing 2 variables: poverty and obesity. Each state is represented with a circle and labeled with its abbreviation. I created my axes and labels displayed at the bottom and left of the chart. I used my local python server to run the visualization.
